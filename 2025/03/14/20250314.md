filter({expr1}, {expr2})				*filter()*
		{expr1} must be a |List|, |String|, |Blob| or |Dictionary|.
		For each item in {expr1} evaluate {expr2} and when the result
		is zero or false remove the item from the |List| or
		|Dictionary|.  Similarly for each byte in a |Blob| and each
		charactor in a |String|.

		{expr2} must be a |string| or |Funcref|.

		If {expr2} is a |string|, inside {expr2} |v:val| has the value
		of the current item.  For a |Dictionary| |v:key| has the key
		of the current item and for a |List| |v:key| has the index of
		the current item.  For a |Blob| |v:key| has the index of the
		current byte. For a |String| |v:key| has the index of the
		current character.
		Examples: >
			call filter(mylist, 'v:val !~ "OLD"')
<		Removes the items where "OLD" appears. >
			call filter(mydict, 'v:key >= 8')
<		Removes the items with a key below 8. >
			call filter(var, 0)
<		Removes all the items, thus clears the |List| or |Dictionary|.

		Note that {expr2} is the result of expression and is then
		used as an expression again.  Often it is good to use a
		|literal-string| to avoid having to double backslashes.

		If {expr2} is a |Funcref| it must take two arguments:
			1. the key or the index of the current item.
			2. the value of the current item.
		The function must return |TRUE| if the item should be kept.
		Example that keeps the odd items of a list: >
			func Odd(idx, val)
			  return a:idx % 2 == 1
			endfunc
			call filter(mylist, function('Odd'))
<		It is shorter when using a |lambda|: >
			call filter(myList, {idx, val -> idx * val <= 42})
<		If you do not use "val" you can leave it out: >
			call filter(myList, {idx -> idx % 2 == 1})
<
		In |Vim9| script the result must be true, false, zero or one.
		Other values will result in a type error.

		For a |List| and a |Dictionary| the operation is done
		in-place.  If you want it to remain unmodified make a copy
		first: >
			:let l = filter(copy(mylist), 'v:val =~ "KEEP"')

<		Returns {expr1}, the |List| or |Dictionary| that was filtered,
		or a new |Blob| or |String|.
		When an error is encountered while evaluating {expr2} no
		further items in {expr1} are processed.
		When {expr2} is a Funcref errors inside a function are ignored,
		unless it was defined with the "abort" flag.

		Can also be used as a |method|: >
			mylist->filter(expr2)


map({expr1}, {expr2})					*map()*
		{expr1} must be a |List|, |String|, |Blob| or |Dictionary|.
		When {expr1} is a |List|| or |Dictionary|, replace each
		item in {expr1} with the result of evaluating {expr2}.
		For a |Blob| each byte is replaced.
		For a |String|, each character, including composing
		characters, is replaced.
		If the item type changes you may want to use |mapnew()| to
		create a new List or Dictionary.  This is required when using
		Vim9 script.

		{expr2} must be a |String| or |Funcref|.

		If {expr2} is a |String|, inside {expr2} |v:val| has the value
		of the current item.  For a |Dictionary| |v:key| has the key
		of the current item and for a |List| |v:key| has the index of
		the current item.  For a |Blob| |v:key| has the index of the

		current character.
		Example: >
			:call map(mylist, '"> " . v:val . " <"')
<		This puts "> " before and " <" after each item in "mylist".

		Note that {expr2} is the result of an expression and is then
		used as an expression again.  Often it is good to use a
		|literal-string| to avoid having to double backslashes.  You
		still have to double ' quotes

		If {expr2} is a |Funcref| it is called with two arguments:
			1. The key or the index of the current item.
			2. the value of the current item.
		The function must return the new value of the item. Example
		that changes each value by "key-value": >
			func KeyValue(key, val)
			  return a:key . '-' . a:val

POPUP FILTER						*popup-filter*

A callback that gets any typed keys while a popup is displayed.  The filter is
not invoked when the popup is hidden.

The filter can return TRUE to indicate the key has been handled and is to be
discarded, or FALSE to let Vim handle the key as usual in the current state.
In case it returns FALSE and there is another popup window visible, that
filter is also called.  The filter of the popup window with the highest zindex
is called first.

The filter function is called with two arguments: the ID of the popup and the
key as a string, e.g.: >
	func MyFilter(winid, key)
	  if a:key == "\<F2>"
	    " do something
	    return 1
	  endif
	  if a:key == 'x'
	    call popup_close(a:winid)
	    return 1
	  endif
	  return 0
	endfunc


how can i make a prompt-popup in vim? and i want to catch every keydown event until <cr> to echo it in vimscript
ChatGPT의 말:
To create a prompt popup in Vim and catch every keydown event until <CR> is pressed, you can use Vim's built-in input() function, along with getchar() to catch each key press.

Steps to create the popup and capture key presses:
Prompt Popup: Vim's input() function allows you to create a prompt for the user to enter a value. However, if you want to capture every key press, you will need to use getchar() or nr2char() to process each key individually.

Capture Every Key Press: You can use a loop to repeatedly call getchar() until <CR> (Enter key) is pressed.

Echo Key Presses: Each key press can be echoed using echo.

Here’s an example of how you can implement this in Vimscript:

vim
복사
function! CaptureKeypress()
  let input_str = ""
  echo "Press keys (Press <CR> to finish):"

  " Loop to capture each key press until <CR>
  while 1
    let key = getchar()  " Get the key
    if key == 13         " If <CR> (Enter) is pressed, exit the loop
      break
    endif

    " Convert the key code to a character and echo it
    let char = nr2char(key)
    let input_str .= char  " Append the character to the input string
    echo "You pressed: " . char
  endwhile

  echo "Final input: " . input_str
endfunction
How it works:
getchar(): This function captures the key press and returns the key's ASCII value.
nr2char(): Converts the numeric key value to the corresponding character.
Loop: The loop will continue to capture key presses until <CR> is detected (which has an ASCII value of 13).
echo: Each captured key is echoed to the user immediately.
To use this function:
Place the function in your .vimrc or in a separate Vim script file.
Call the function using :call CaptureKeypress().
This will allow you to see the keys as you press them, and the function will finish when <CR> is pressed.


나의 말:
with input list consists of four idiom with interactive prompt as a fuzzy finding filter?
ChatGPT의 말:
To create an interactive fuzzy-finding prompt in Vim where you can select from a list of idioms, you can utilize Vim’s inputlist() function, along with a fuzzy search method. Although Vim doesn’t natively support fuzzy finding like some modern tools, you can implement a simple fuzzy search using regular expressions or basic filtering logic.

Below is an example implementation of a fuzzy-finding prompt using an interactive list for idioms, where the list contains four idioms, and you can filter the results interactively:

Step-by-Step Guide:
List of Idioms: You can define a list of idioms that you want to provide as options.
Interactive Filtering: As you type, the available list of idioms should update to reflect the fuzzy search.
Input Handling: Use inputlist() to present the list and filter it based on the user’s input.
Example Vimscript Code:
vim
복사
function! FuzzyFindIdiom()
  " Define the list of idioms
  let idioms = [
        \ 'Break the ice',
        \ 'Bite the bullet',
        \ 'Burn the midnight oil',
        \ 'Hit the nail on the head'
        \]

  " Initial search term (empty at the start)
  let search_term = ""
  let filtered_idioms = idioms

  " Loop for interactive search
  while 1
    " Ask for user input
    let search_term = input('Search for idioms: ' . search_term)

    " If user presses <CR> or cancels, break the loop
    if search_term == "" || search_term == "\n"
      break
    endif

    " Filter the list based on the search term using a basic fuzzy search
    let filtered_idioms = filter(idioms, 'v:val =~ search_term')

    " Display the filtered list of idioms
    if len(filtered_idioms) > 0
      let selected_idiom = inputlist(filtered_idioms)
    else
      echo "No matching idioms found!"
    endif

    " If a valid selection is made (inputlist returns non-zero index), break the loop
    if selected_idiom > 0
      echo 'You selected: ' . filtered_idioms[selected_idiom - 1]
      break
    endif
  endwhile
endfunction
Explanation:
input(): This is used to get the user's input for filtering. As the user types, the list of idioms is filtered.
filter(): This is used to filter the list of idioms using a regular expression that matches the search_term.
inputlist(): Once the list is filtered, the filtered list of idioms is shown using inputlist(), allowing the user to select an idiom from the list.
selected_idiom: The selected idiom is displayed once the user picks an item.
How it works:
The user types a search term to filter the list of idioms.
The list updates dynamically to reflect the search term.
The user selects an idiom from the filtered list, and the chosen idiom is echoed.
If the user presses <CR> without input, the loop exits.
To use:
Add this function to your .vimrc or a separate Vim script file.
Call the function with :call FuzzyFindIdiom().
Example of Interaction:
markdown
복사
Search for idioms: B
1. Break the ice
2. Bite the bullet
3. Burn the midnight oil
4. Hit the nail on the head
You type B and the list updates to show only idioms starting with "B". The user can select one, and the selection is echoed.

This is a simple fuzzy search using basic pattern matching. If you want a more sophisticated fuzzy-finding feature (like what you would find in tools like fzf), you might need to use an external plugin like fzf.vim to achieve advanced fuzzy search functionality.


나의 말:
can i sort for my sortkey function for the given list?
ChatGPT의 말:
Yes, you can sort the list based on a custom sort key in Vim by using the sort() function with a custom comparator. If you want to sort the idioms based on some criteria, such as alphabetically or by the length of the idioms, you can define a sorting function and pass it as a parameter to sort().

Example: Sorting the idioms based on a custom sort key
In the context of the previous script, let's say you want to sort the idioms based on:

Alphabetically (default string sorting).
By the length of the idioms (in ascending or descending order).
You can create a custom sort function and use it with the sort() function.

Example Vimscript with Sorting by Custom Sort Key:
vim
복사
function! FuzzyFindIdiom()
  " Define the list of idioms
  let idioms = [
        \ 'Break the ice',
        \ 'Bite the bullet',
        \ 'Burn the midnight oil',
        \ 'Hit the nail on the head'
        \]

  " Function to sort idioms alphabetically
  function! SortAlphabetically(a, b)
    return a < b ? -1 : a > b ? 1 : 0
  endfunction

  " Function to sort idioms by length
  function! SortByLength(a, b)
    return len(a) < len(b) ? -1 : len(a) > len(b) ? 1 : 0
  endfunction

  " Sort the idioms alphabetically
  call sort(idioms, 'SortAlphabetically')

  " Alternatively, sort by length of the idioms
  " call sort(idioms, 'SortByLength')

  " Display the sorted list for verification
  echo "Sorted Idioms:"
  echo idioms

  " Initial search term (empty at the start)
  let search_term = ""
  let filtered_idioms = idioms

  " Loop for interactive search
  while 1
    " Ask for user input
    let search_term = input('Search for idioms: ' . search_term)

    " If user presses <CR> or cancels, break the loop
    if search_term == "" || search_term == "\n"
      break
    endif

    " Filter the list based on the search term using a basic fuzzy search
    let filtered_idioms = filter(idioms, 'v:val =~ search_term')

    " Display the filtered list of idioms
    if len(filtered_idioms) > 0
      let selected_idiom = inputlist(filtered_idioms)
    else
      echo "No matching idioms found!"
    endif

    " If a valid selection is made (inputlist returns non-zero index), break the loop
    if selected_idiom > 0
      echo 'You selected: ' . filtered_idioms[selected_idiom - 1]
      break
    endif
  endwhile
endfunction
Explanation:
Custom Sort Functions:
SortAlphabetically: Sorts the list alphabetically.
SortByLength: Sorts the list by the length of each idiom.
sort() Function: The sort() function is called with the custom sorting function ('SortAlphabetically' or 'SortByLength') to sort the idioms list before filtering or interacting.
How to Use:
Alphabetical Sorting: This is the default in the script, using the SortAlphabetically function.
Sort by Length: If you prefer sorting idioms by their length instead, simply comment/uncomment the respective call sort() line (SortByLength).
Example Output for Alphabetical Sorting:
If the idioms are sorted alphabetically:

less
복사
Sorted Idioms:
['Bite the bullet', 'Break the ice', 'Burn the midnight oil', 'Hit the nail on the head']
If sorted by length:

less
복사
Sorted Idioms:
['Bite the bullet', 'Break the ice', 'Hit the nail on the head', 'Burn the midnight oil']
This allows you to sort your idioms list dynamically by a custom key (alphabetically, by length, or any other criterion).


나의 말:
can i apply interactive user prompt as a filter not on input list but popup_menu?
ChatGPT의 말:
Yes, you can use an interactive user prompt to filter and dynamically update a popup menu in Vim, which is more flexible than using inputlist() for static lists. In this case, we can simulate a fuzzy search using a prompt, and when the user types, we filter the list of idioms and update the popup menu accordingly.

To do this, we can use the popupmenu feature introduced in Vim 8, combined with an interactive prompt that filters the options as the user types.

Here’s how you can create a popup menu where the list is filtered based on the user's input:

Example Vimscript to Use a Popup Menu with Interactive Search:
vim
복사
function! FuzzyFindIdiomPopup()
  " Define the list of idioms
  let idioms = [
        \ 'Break the ice',
        \ 'Bite the bullet',
        \ 'Burn the midnight oil',
        \ 'Hit the nail on the head'
        \]

  " Initial search term (empty at the start)
  let search_term = ""
  let filtered_idioms = idioms
  let selected_idiom = -1

  " Function to display the popup menu
  function! ShowPopup(filtered_idioms)
    " If there are idioms to show
    if len(a:filtered_idioms) > 0
      " Display the popup menu
      call popupmenu#show(a:filtered_idioms)
    else
      echo "No matching idioms found!"
    endif
  endfunction

  " Loop for interactive search
  while 1
    " Get the search term from the user input
    let search_term = input('Search for idioms: ' . search_term)

    " If user presses <CR> or cancels, break the loop
    if search_term == "" || search_term == "\n"
      break
    endif

    " Filter the idioms based on the search term (simple fuzzy search using regex)
    let filtered_idioms = filter(idioms, 'v:val =~ search_term')

    " Show the popup menu with the filtered list
    call ShowPopup(filtered_idioms)

    " Wait for user input (simulating keydown)
    let selected_idiom = input('Select an idiom number or press <CR> to select: ')

    " If user selects an item or presses <CR>, break the loop
    if selected_idiom == "\n" || selected_idiom =~ '^\d\+$'
      let idx = str2nr(selected_idiom) - 1
      if idx >= 0 && idx < len(filtered_idioms)
        echo 'You selected: ' . filtered_idioms[idx]
        break
      else
        echo "Invalid selection!"
      endif
    endif
  endwhile
endfunction
How this works:
List of Idioms: You define your idioms list as usual.
Popup Menu: We use the popupmenu#show() function to show the filtered idioms as a popup menu.
Fuzzy Filtering: The search term is applied to filter the list of idioms using filter() and a simple regex match (=~).
Interactive Input: The user is prompted to type and filter the idioms interactively. The filtered idioms are then displayed in the popup menu.
Selection: The user can either press <CR> to select the item or type the number corresponding to the item in the popup menu.
Breakdown of Functions:
ShowPopup(): This function displays the filtered idioms as a popup menu.
input(): This function is used to get the user’s input to filter the idioms list.
popupmenu#show(): This is the command that opens the popup menu with the filtered list of idioms.
To Use:
Add this function to your .vimrc or a separate Vim script file.
Call it using :call FuzzyFindIdiomPopup().
Example of Interaction:
You start typing in the prompt:

less
복사
Search for idioms: B
The filtered idioms are shown in the popup menu (e.g., Bite the bullet and Break the ice).

You can select an idiom by pressing <CR> or by entering its corresponding number.

If no match is found, it will notify the user.

Notes:
popupmenu#show(): This command shows the filtered list as a popup menu. The user can select an item by typing its number or pressing <CR> when the item is highlighted.
Fuzzy Search: The filtering is based on a simple regex search (=~), which works for partial matches. You can expand this to include more advanced fuzzy searching logic if needed, using Vim plugins like fzf.vim for a more advanced search experience.
This gives you the benefit of an interactive popup menu that dynamically updates based on user input, making it much more user-friendly for selecting from a list of idioms.
