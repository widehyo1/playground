	The characters specified by this option are included in file names and
	path names.  Filenames are used for commands like "gf", "[i" and in
	the tags file.  It is also used for "\f" in a |pattern|.
	Multi-byte characters 256 and above are always included, only the
	characters up to 255 are specified with this option.
	For UTF-8 the characters 0xa0 to 0xff are included as well.
	Think twice before adding white space to this option.  Although a
	space may appear inside a file name, the effect will be that Vim
	doesn't know where a file name starts or ends when doing completion.
	It most likely works better without a space in 'isfname'.

	Note that on systems using a backslash as path separator, Vim tries to
	do its best to make it work as you would expect.  That is a bit
	tricky, since Vi originally used the backslash to escape special
	characters.  Vim will not remove a backslash in front of a normal file
	name character on these systems, but it will on Unix and alikes.  The
	'&' and '^' are not included by default, because these are special for
	cmd.exe.

	The format of this option is a list of parts, separated with commas.
	Each part can be a single character number or a range.  A range is two
	character numbers with '-' in between.  A character number can be a
	decimal number between 0 and 255 or the ASCII character itself (does
	not work for digits).  Example:
		"_,-,128-140,#-43"	(include '_' and '-' and the range
					128 to 140 and '#' to 43)
	If a part starts with '^', the following character number or range
	will be excluded from the option.  The option is interpreted from left
	to right.  Put the excluded character after the range where it is
	included.  To include '^' itself use it as the last character of the
	option or the end of a range.  Example:
		"^a-z,#,^"	(exclude 'a' to 'z', include '#' and '^')
	If the character is '@', all characters where isalpha() returns TRUE
	are included.  Normally these are the characters a to z and A to Z,
	plus accented characters.  To include '@' itself use "@-@".  Examples:
		"@,^a-z"	All alphabetic characters, excluding lower
				case ASCII letters.
		"a-z,A-Z,@-@"	All letters plus the '@' character.
	A comma can be included by using it where a character number is
	expected.  Example:
		"48-57,,,_"	Digits, comma and underscore.
	A comma can be excluded by prepending a '^'.  Example:
		" -~,^,,9"	All characters from space to '~', excluding
				comma, plus <Tab>.
	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.

CTRL-G		or				*CTRL-G* *:f* *:fi* *:file*
:f[ile]			Prints the current file name (as typed, unless ":cd"
			was used), the cursor position (unless the 'ruler'
			option is set), and the file status (readonly,
			modified, read errors, new file).  See the 'shortmess'
			option about how to make this message shorter.

:f[ile]!		like |:file|, but don't truncate the name even when
			'shortmess' indicates this.

{count}CTRL-G		Like CTRL-G, but prints the current file name with
			full path.  If the count is higher than 1 the current
			buffer number is also given.

					*g_CTRL-G* *word-count* *byte-count*
g CTRL-G		Prints the current position of the cursor in five
			ways: Column, Line, Word, Character and Byte.  If the
			number of Characters and Bytes is the same then the
			Character position is omitted.

			If there are characters in the line that take more
			than one position on the screen (<Tab> or special
			character), or characters using more than one byte per
			column (characters above 0x7F when 'encoding' is
			utf-8), both the byte column and the screen column are
			shown, separated by a dash.

			Also see the 'ruler' option and the |wordcount()|
			function.

							*v_g_CTRL-G*
{Visual}g CTRL-G	Similar to "g CTRL-G", but Word, Character, Line, and
			Byte counts for the visually selected region are
			displayed.
			In Blockwise mode, Column count is also shown.  (For
			{Visual} see |Visual-mode|.)
