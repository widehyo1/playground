5. Text object motions					*object-motions*

							*(*
(			[count] sentences backward.  |exclusive| motion.

							*)*
)			[count] sentences forward.  |exclusive| motion.

							*{*
{			[count] paragraphs backward.  |exclusive| motion.

							*}*
}			[count] paragraphs forward.  |exclusive| motion.

							*]]*
]]			[count] sections forward or to the next '{' in the
			first column.  When used after an operator, then also
			stops below a '}' in the first column.  |exclusive|
			Note that |exclusive-linewise| often applies.

							*][*
][			[count] sections forward or to the next '}' in the
			first column.  |exclusive|
			Note that |exclusive-linewise| often applies.

							*[[*
[[			[count] sections backward or to the previous '{' in
			the first column.  |exclusive|
			Note that |exclusive-linewise| often applies.

							*[]*
[]			[count] sections backward or to the previous '}' in
			the first column.  |exclusive|
			Note that |exclusive-linewise| often applies.

These commands move over three kinds of text objects.

							*sentence*
A sentence is defined as ending at a '.', '!' or '?' followed by either the
end of a line, or by a space or tab.  Any number of closing ')', ']', '"'
and ''' characters may appear after the '.', '!' or '?' before the spaces,
tabs or end of line.  A paragraph and section boundary is also a sentence
boundary.
If the 'J' flag is present in 'cpoptions', at least two spaces have to
follow the punctuation mark; <Tab>s are not recognized as white space.
The definition of a sentence cannot be changed.

							*paragraph*
A paragraph begins after each empty line, and also at each of a set of
paragraph macros, specified by the pairs of characters in the 'paragraphs'
option.  The default is "IPLPPPQPP TPHPLIPpLpItpplpipbp", which corresponds to
the macros ".IP", ".LP", etc.  (These are nroff macros, so the dot must be in
the first column).  A section boundary is also a paragraph boundary.
Note that a blank line (only containing white space) is NOT a paragraph
boundary.
Also note that this does not include a '{' or '}' in the first column.  When
the '{' flag is in 'cpoptions' then '{' in the first column is used as a
paragraph boundary |posix|.

							*section*
A section begins after a form-feed (<C-L>) in the first column and at each of
a set of section macros, specified by the pairs of characters in the
'sections' option.  The default is "SHNHH HUnhsh", which defines a section to
start at the nroff macros ".SH", ".NH", ".H", ".HU", ".nh" and ".sh".

The "]]" and "[[" commands stop at the '{' in the first column.  This is
useful to find the start of a function in a C program.  To search for a '}' in
the first column, the end of a C function, use "][" (forward) or "[]"
(backward).  Note that the first character of the command determines the
search direction.

If your '{' or '}' are not in the first column, and you would like to use "[["
and "]]" anyway, try these mappings: >
   :map [[ ?{<CR>w99[{
   :map ][ /}<CR>b99]}
   :map ]] j0[[%/{<CR>
   :map [] k$][%?}<CR>
[type these literally, see |<>|]

6. Text object selection			*object-select* *text-objects*
						*v_a* *v_i*

This is a series of commands that can only be used while in Visual mode or
after an operator.  The commands that start with "a" select "a"n object
including white space, the commands starting with "i" select an "inner" object
without white space, or just the white space.  Thus the "inner" commands
always select less text than the "a" commands.

These commands are not available when the |+textobjects| feature has been
disabled at compile time.
Also see `gn` and `gN`, operating on the last search pattern.

							*v_aw* *aw*
aw			"a word", select [count] words (see |word|).
			Leading or trailing white space is included, but not
			counted.
			When used in Visual linewise mode "aw" switches to
			Visual characterwise mode.

							*v_iw* *iw*
iw			"inner word", select [count] words (see |word|).
			White space between words is counted too.
			When used in Visual linewise mode "iw" switches to
			Visual characterwise mode.

							*v_aW* *aW*
aW			"a WORD", select [count] WORDs (see |WORD|).
			Leading or trailing white space is included, but not
			counted.
			When used in Visual linewise mode "aW" switches to
			Visual characterwise mode.

							*v_iW* *iW*
iW			"inner WORD", select [count] WORDs (see |WORD|).
			White space between words is counted too.
			When used in Visual linewise mode "iW" switches to
			Visual characterwise mode.

							*v_as* *as*
as			"a sentence", select [count] sentences (see
			|sentence|).
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.

							*v_is* *is*
is			"inner sentence", select [count] sentences (see
			|sentence|).
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.

							*v_ap* *ap*
ap			"a paragraph", select [count] paragraphs (see
			|paragraph|).
			Exception: a blank line (only containing white space)
			is also a paragraph boundary.
			When used in Visual mode it is made linewise.

							*v_ip* *ip*
ip			"inner paragraph", select [count] paragraphs (see
			|paragraph|).
			Exception: a blank line (only containing white space)
			is also a paragraph boundary.
			When used in Visual mode it is made linewise.

a]						*v_a]* *v_a[* *a]* *a[*
a[			"a [] block", select [count] '[' ']' blocks.  This
			goes backwards to the [count] unclosed '[', and finds
			the matching ']'.  The enclosed text is selected,
			including the '[' and ']'.
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.

i]						*v_i]* *v_i[* *i]* *i[*
i[			"inner [] block", select [count] '[' ']' blocks.  This
			goes backwards to the [count] unclosed '[', and finds
			the matching ']'.  The enclosed text is selected,
			excluding the '[' and ']'.
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.

a)							*v_a)* *a)* *a(*
a(							*vab* *v_ab* *v_a(* *ab*
ab			"a block", select [count] blocks, from "[count] [(" to
			the matching ')', including the '(' and ')' (see
			|[(|).  Does not include white space outside of the
			parenthesis.
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.

i)							*v_i)* *i)* *i(*
i(							*vib* *v_ib* *v_i(* *ib*
ib			"inner block", select [count] blocks, from "[count] [("
			to the matching ')', excluding the '(' and ')' (see
			|[(|).
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.

a>						*v_a>* *v_a<* *a>* *a<*
a<			"a <> block", select [count] <> blocks, from the
			[count]'th unmatched '<' backwards to the matching
			'>', including the '<' and '>'.
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.

i>						*v_i>* *v_i<* *i>* *i<*
i<			"inner <> block", select [count] <> blocks, from
			the [count]'th unmatched '<' backwards to the matching
			'>', excluding the '<' and '>'.
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.

						*v_at* *at*
at			"a tag block", select [count] tag blocks, from the
			[count]'th unmatched "<aaa>" backwards to the matching
			"</aaa>", including the "<aaa>" and "</aaa>".
			See |tag-blocks| about the details.
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.

						*v_it* *it*
it			"inner tag block", select [count] tag blocks, from the
			[count]'th unmatched "<aaa>" backwards to the matching
			"</aaa>", excluding the "<aaa>" and "</aaa>".
			See |tag-blocks| about the details.
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.

a}							*v_a}* *a}* *a{*
a{							*v_aB* *v_a{* *aB*
aB			"a Block", select [count] Blocks, from "[count] [{" to
			the matching '}', including the '{' and '}' (see
			|[{|).
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.

i}							*v_i}* *i}* *i{*
i{							*v_iB* *v_i{* *iB*
iB			"inner Block", select [count] Blocks, from "[count] [{"
			to the matching '}', excluding the '{' and '}' (see
			|[{|).
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.

a"							*v_aquote* *aquote*
a'							*v_a'* *a'*
a`							*v_a`* *a`*
			"a quoted string".  Selects the text from the previous
			quote until the next quote.  The 'quoteescape' option
			is used to skip escaped quotes.
			Only works within one line.
			When the cursor starts on a quote, Vim will figure out
			which quote pairs form a string by searching from the
			start of the line.
			Any trailing white space is included, unless there is
			none, then leading white space is included.
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.
			Repeating this object in Visual mode another string is
			included.  A count is currently not used.

i"							*v_iquote* *iquote*
i'							*v_i'* *i'*
i`							*v_i`* *i`*
			Like a", a' and a`, but exclude the quotes and
			repeating won't extend the Visual selection.
			Special case: With a count of 2 the quotes are
			included, but no extra white space as with a"/a'/a`.

When used after an operator:
For non-block objects:
	For the "a" commands: The operator applies to the object and the white
	space after the object.  If there is no white space after the object
	or when the cursor was in the white space before the object, the white
	space before the object is included.
	For the "inner" commands: If the cursor was on the object, the
	operator applies to the object.  If the cursor was on white space, the
	operator applies to the white space.
For a block object:
	The operator applies to the block where the cursor is in, or the block
	on which the cursor is on one of the braces.  For the "inner" commands
	the surrounding braces are excluded.  For the "a" commands, the braces
	are included.

When used in Visual mode:
When start and end of the Visual area are the same (just after typing "v"):
	One object is selected, the same as for using an operator.
When start and end of the Visual area are not the same:
	For non-block objects the area is extended by one object or the white
	space up to the next object, or both for the "a" objects.  The
	direction in which this happens depends on which side of the Visual
	area the cursor is.  For the block objects the block is extended one
	level outwards.

For illustration, here is a list of delete commands, grouped from small to big
objects.  Note that for a single character and a whole line the existing vi
movement commands are used.
	"dl"	delete character (alias: "x")		|dl|
	"diw"	delete inner word			*diw*
	"daw"	delete a word				*daw*
	"diW"	delete inner WORD (see |WORD|)		*diW*
	"daW"	delete a WORD (see |WORD|)		*daW*
	"dgn"   delete the next search pattern match    *dgn*
	"dd"	delete one line				|dd|
	"dis"	delete inner sentence			*dis*
	"das"	delete a sentence			*das*
	"dib"	delete inner '(' ')' block		*dib*
	"dab"	delete a '(' ')' block			*dab*
	"dip"	delete inner paragraph			*dip*
	"dap"	delete a paragraph			*dap*
	"diB"	delete inner '{' '}' block		*diB*
	"daB"	delete a '{' '}' block			*daB*

Note the difference between using a movement command and an object.  The
movement command operates from here (cursor position) to where the movement
takes us.  When using an object the whole object is operated upon, no matter
where on the object the cursor is.  For example, compare "dw" and "daw": "dw"
deletes from the cursor position to the start of the next word, "daw" deletes
the word under the cursor and the space after or before it.


Tag blocks						*tag-blocks*

For the "it" and "at" text objects an attempt is done to select blocks between
matching tags for HTML and XML.  But since these are not completely compatible
there are a few restrictions.

The normal method is to select a <tag> until the matching </tag>.  For "at"
the tags are included, for "it" they are excluded.  But when "it" is repeated
the tags will be included (otherwise nothing would change).  Also, "it" used
on a tag block with no contents will select the leading tag.

"<aaa/>" items are skipped.  Case is ignored, also for XML where case does
matter.

In HTML it is possible to have a tag like <br> or <meta ...> without a
matching end tag.  These are ignored.

The text objects are tolerant about mistakes.  Stray end tags are ignored.

4.2 Substitute						*:substitute*
							*:s* *:su*
:[range]s[ubstitute]/{pattern}/{string}/[flags] [count]
			For each line in [range] replace a match of {pattern}
			with {string}.
			For the {pattern} see |pattern|.
			{string} can be a literal string, or something
			special; see |sub-replace-special|.
			When [range] and [count] are omitted, replace in the
			current line only.  When [count] is given, replace in
			[count] lines, starting with the last line in [range].
			When [range] is omitted start in the current line.
							*E939* *E1510*
			[count] must be a positive number (max 2147483647)
			Also see |cmdline-ranges|.

			See |:s_flags| for [flags].
			The delimiter doesn't need to be /, see
			|pattern-delimiter|.

:[range]s[ubstitute] [flags] [count]
:[range]&[&][flags] [count]					*:&*
			Repeat last :substitute with same search pattern and
			substitute string, but without the same flags.  You
			may add [flags], see |:s_flags|.
			Note that after `:substitute` the '&' flag can't be
			used, it's recognized as a pattern separator.
			The space between `:substitute` and the 'c', 'g',
			'i', 'I' and 'r' flags isn't required, but in scripts
			it's a good idea to keep it to avoid confusion.
			Also see the two and three letter commands to repeat
			:substitute below |:substitute-repeat|.

:[range]~[&][flags] [count]					*:~*
			Repeat last substitute with same substitute string
			but with last used search pattern.  This is like
			`:&r`.  See |:s_flags| for [flags].

								*&*
&			Synonym for `:s` (repeat last substitute).  Note
			that the flags are not remembered, thus it might
			actually work differently.  You can use `:&&` to keep
			the flags.

								*g&*
g&			Synonym for `:%s//~/&` (repeat last substitute with
			last search pattern on all lines with the same flags).
			For example, when you first do a substitution with
			`:s/pattern/repl/flags` and then `/search` for
			something else, `g&` will do `:%s/search/repl/flags`.
			Mnemonic: global substitute.

						*:snomagic* *:sno*
:[range]sno[magic] ...	Same as `:substitute`, but always use 'nomagic'.

						*:smagic* *:sm*
:[range]sm[agic] ...	Same as `:substitute`, but always use 'magic'.

							*:s_flags*
The flags that you can use for the substitute commands:

							*:&&*
[&]	Must be the first one: Keep the flags from the previous substitute
	command.  Examples: >
		:&&
		:s/this/that/&
<	Note that `:s` and `:&` don't keep the flags.

[c]	Confirm each substitution.  Vim highlights the matching string (with
	|hl-IncSearch|).  You can type:				*:s_c*
	    'y'	    to substitute this match
	    'l'	    to substitute this match and then quit ("last")
	    'n'	    to skip this match
	    <Esc>   to quit substituting
	    'a'	    to substitute this and all remaining matches
	    'q'	    to quit substituting
	    CTRL-E  to scroll the screen up
	    CTRL-Y  to scroll the screen down
	If the 'edcompatible' option is on, Vim remembers the [c] flag and
	toggles it each time you use it, but resets it when you give a new
	search pattern.

							*:s_e*
[e]     When the search pattern fails, do not issue an error message and, in
	particular, continue in maps as if no error occurred.  This is most
	useful to prevent the "No match" error from breaking a mapping.  Vim
	does not suppress the following error messages, however:
		Regular expressions can't be delimited by letters
		\ should be followed by /, ? or &
		No previous substitute regular expression
		Trailing characters
		Interrupted

							*:s_g*
[g]	Replace all occurrences in the line.  Without this argument,
	replacement occurs only for the first occurrence in each line.  If
	the 'edcompatible' option is on, Vim remembers this flag and toggles
	it each time you use it, but resets it when you give a new search
	pattern.  If the 'gdefault' option is on, this flag is on by default
	and the [g] argument switches it off.

							*:s_i*
[i]	Ignore case for the pattern.  The 'ignorecase' and 'smartcase' options
	are not used.

							*:s_I*
[I]	Don't ignore case for the pattern.  The 'ignorecase' and 'smartcase'
	options are not used.

							*:s_n*
[n]	Report the number of matches, do not actually substitute.  The [c]
	flag is ignored.  The matches are reported as if 'report' is zero.
	Useful to |count-items|.
	If \= |sub-replace-expression| is used, the expression will be
	evaluated in the |sandbox| at every match.

[p]	Print the line containing the last substitute.  *:s_p*

[#]	Like [p] and prepend the line number.  *:s_#*

[l]	Like [p] but print the text like |:list|.  *:s_l*

							*:s_r*
[r]	Only useful in combination with `:&` or `:s` without arguments.  `:&r`
	works the same way as `:~`:  When the search pattern is empty, use the
	previously used search pattern instead of the search pattern from the
	last substitute or `:global`.  If the last command that did a search
	was a substitute or `:global`, there is no effect.  If the last
	command was a search command such as "/", use the pattern from that
	command.
	For `:s` with an argument this already happens: >
		:s/blue/red/
		/green
		:s//red/   or  :~   or  :&r
<	The last commands will replace "green" with "red". >
		:s/blue/red/
		/green
		:&
<	The last command will replace "blue" with "red".

Note that there is no flag to change the "magicness" of the pattern.  A
different command is used instead, or you can use |/\v| and friends.  The
reason is that the flags can only be found by skipping the pattern, and in
order to skip the pattern the "magicness" must be known.  Catch 22!

If the {pattern} for the substitute command is empty, the command uses the
pattern from the last substitute or `:global` command.  If there is none, but
there is a previous search pattern, that one is used.  With the [r] flag, the
command uses the pattern from the last substitute, `:global`, or search
command.

If the {string} is omitted the substitute is done as if it's empty.  Thus the
matched pattern is deleted.  The separator after {pattern} can also be left
out then.  Example: >
	:%s/TESTING
This deletes "TESTING" from all lines, but only one per line.

For compatibility with Vi these two exceptions are allowed:
"\/{string}/" and "\?{string}?" do the same as "//{string}/r".
"\&{string}&" does the same as "//{string}/".
```
