These are all the program and data files for The AWK
Programming Language, second edition.  Some of the early
or tiniest examples, for example, from Chapter 1, do not
appear here; they are inline in the text of the book.
(That's not always a good idea, of course, since it
prevents automated testing.)

The beer review files have been compressed with gzip.

There are also some extra files, not mentioned in the
book, that might provide some test harness or extra data,
or that might just be dregs that I failed to remove.  In
the fullness of time, I hope to make this information more
orderly, but don't hold your breath while waiting.

Do let us know of any problems; mail to info@awk.dev.

Thanks!
