a rolling stone:gathers no moss
history:repeats itself
he who lives by the sword:shall die by the sword
father:knows best
a jack of all trades:is master of none
nature:abhors a vacuum
every man:has a price
all's well that:ends well
the exception:proves the rule
a rose by any other name:would smell as sweet
